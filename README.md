# Impact-based Forecast for Critical Infrastructure during Tropical Cyclones 

Forecasting the potential impact of weather extremes in the weeks to days before they happen can help increase the preparedness in the areas that might be
affected. The emerging field of research on impact-based forecast models is instrumental in this regard, aiding international organizations and governments in making informed decisions,
taking early actions, and allocating resources efficiently. This study aims to build upon the pioneering research of the Weather4UN project, by developing and impact forecast tool of
tropical cyclones on critical infrastructure. While earlier efforts concentrated on estimating the potential affected population, our focus shifts to understanding the impact on critical
infrastructure, starting with healthcare facilities, schools and road networks. We present a case study of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Freddy, which hit Mozambique and Madagascar in 2023.
We calculate direct impacts using two sets of vulnerability curves for structural damage and another based on the Saffir-Simpson scale to ensure global applicability when needed. To
better understand the significance of these impacts, we further assess their indirect effects on the population.

## Structure
The scripts consist in: 
- Hazard data (Fetching the forecast) ECMWF 51 ensemble members (IFS Cycle 47r3)
- Exposure data
  Hospitals, Educational facilities, roads
  Worldpop (UN adjust 2020)
- Impact Function/ vulnerability
  Eberenz et. al (2021) & Deltares Institute (Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, 2023)
  Saffir Simpson hurricane wind scale
